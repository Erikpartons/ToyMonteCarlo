To extract the event-by-event correlation between the multiplicity and transverse momentum from ALICE data



One of the main programs that I developed in my Master in Physics. 
This code was built into the software for data analysis ROOT, in order to extract the event-by-event correlation between multiplicity and transverse momentum from the available ALICE proton-proton collisions data at 5.02, 7 and 13 TeV (you can dowload the public data from: https://www.hepdata.net/record/ins1684320 and https://www.hepdata.net/record/ins1735345).
